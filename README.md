## About this mod

Project Diablo 2 team did amazing job and stunned me and the other veteran D2 players with their high quality work. However, not everyone has the time to farm 24/7. This mod is for players that enjoy slaying plethora of monsters in Diablo 2, but don't have that much time to play in the way the Diablo 2 game and PD2 mod were designed, with abyssmal drop rates and item scarcity. If you have Infinity by day 3 of the PD2 ladder, then this mod is not for you.

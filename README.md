# PD2-Single-player-mod

Current version: 1.0.0

## About this mod

Project Diablo 2 team did amazing job and stunned me and the other veteran D2 players with their high quality work. However, not everyone has the time to farm 24/7. This mod is for players that enjoy slaying plethora of monsters in Diablo 2, but don't have that much time to play in the way the Diablo 2 game and PD2 mod were designed, with abyssmal drop rates and item scarcity. If you have Infinity by day 3 of the PD2 ladder, then this mod is not for you.

## How to install

1. Create a copy of your Diablo 2 game with Project Diablo 2 mod installed to a new directory.
2. Install PD2 Plugy for SP by BetweenWalls: https://github.com/BetweenWalls/PD2-PlugY#pd2-plugy.
3. Head to "Releases" and download most recent version of this mod.
4. Paste the downloaded "pd2data.mpq" file to ProjectD2 folder at your client directory, that you've created at step 1.
5. Use the recommended loot filter from "Releases" or adjust your personal loot filter, using new items codes on the bottom of this page (loot filter knowledge required).

## General loot table changes

* Rune drop rates increased by 500%. This means that when a rune drops it is 5 times less likely to downgrade to lower rune class. This change results in much more high and mid rune drops and much less lower rune drops
* All act bosses in all difficulties are now permanently quest bugged
* Chipped and normal gems removed from Hell “good drops” treasure class, resulting in more good drops (hard to estimate by how much %), also to make rooms in TC for custom items
* Jewelry drop rates was decreased by 16%, allowing for higher chance of other drops
* WSS drop rates increased by 500%
* Perfect gems drop rates increased by 450%
* Larzuk’s puzzle piece and Larzuk’s puzzle box were moved to a dedicated treasure class, which will result in more drops and won’t interfere with rune drops (in vanilla PD2, LPP was sharing treasure class with Mal and Ist, and LBOX with Gul and Vex)
* Map drop rates outside of maps increased by 1100% and inside maps by 300%
* Diablo’s Burning Essence of Terror drop rate set at 15% in Hell

  * baal throne room
  * arcane sanctuary
* Champion packs density increased in above mentioned zones in Hell difficulty by 1-2 packs per zone
* Monster immunities in T4 Dungeon lowered to 110%, so it can be broken just by single source of minus immunity, eg. Infinity Conviction Aura

## Cube item exchange

* 3x Larzuk’s Puzzle Piece + Mal = Larzuk’s Puzzle Box
* Larzuk’s Puzzle Box + Vex = 2x Larzuk’s Puzzle Box
* Larzuk’s Puzzle Box + Key = Vex
* Larzuk’s Puzzle Piece + Key = Mal
* Lilith’s Mirror + Key = 4x Ber

* Runes can be downgraded without diminishing returns up to Ist and after Ist will only give 1 rune instead of 2. Recipe: Not-stacked rune + Key

## New orbs

A couple of new orbs have been introduced to ease the hunt for perfect unique and set items. All below mentioned items drop (3% chance from “good drops” TC) in Hell difficulty:

Mythic orb - allows normal/magic/rare armor/weapon to be transformed into a unique item of that base. Allows magic/rare rings and amulets to be transformed into unique. Items must be non-ethereal and non-corrupted. Cube with 25 jewel fragments to create a random rainbow facet. Sockets will be removed.
Divine orb - allows to reroll mod values on unique or set weapon/armor. Unique items must have no sockets, be non-corrupted. Set items must have no-sockets and be non-corrupted. IF USED ON BASE THAT HAS MORE THAN ONE UNIQUE ITEM BOUND TO IT, IT CAN REROLL THE UNIQUE ITEM, eg. Tyrael’s Might can be changed to Templar’s Might.
Exalted orb - allows normal/magic/rare armor/weapon to be transformed into a set item of that base. Allows magic/rare rings and amulets to be transformed into set items. Items must be non-ethereal and non-corrupted. Sockets will be removed

## New unique items

## Fate shards

To ease the hunt for hardest to get items that can’t be deterministically obtained with Mythic Orb, like rings and amulets, a system called “Fate shards” was introduced. These shards are an uncommon drop from anywhere in hell (1.27% chance from “good drops” TC). All of the shards have the same weighting, but the better items require more shards.

A stack of shards can be transformed in the cube for the item. Below are the shards that are in the game at the moment - name of the shard, how many of shard is required to get the item and what item it gives:

* “Lawful Sentence” - stack of 3 - Tal Rasha’s Adjudication
* “Luminescence” - stack of 3 - Mara’s Kaleidoscope
* “Ammuit Treasure” - stack of 3 - Stone of Jordan
* “Untethered Soul” - stack of 3 - Wisp projector
* “Rotting Bride” - stack of 3 - Bul-Kathos’ wedding band
* “The Man from the High Castle” - stack of 3 - Highlord’s Wrath
* “Dawn” - stack of 3 - Rising Sun
* “Dark Alchemist” - stack of 5 - Vial of Lightsong
* “Hatred’s Reflection” - stack of 5 - Lilith’s Mirror

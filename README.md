## About this mod

Project Diablo 2 team did amazing job and stunned me and the other veteran D2 players with their high quality work. However, not everyone has the time to farm 24/7. This mod is for players that enjoy slaying plethora of monsters in Diablo 2, but don't have that much time to play in the way the Diablo 2 game and PD2 mod were designed, with abyssmal drop rates and item scarcity. If you have Infinity by day 3 of the PD2 ladder, then this mod is not for you.

## Multiplayer

The mod works fully in local TCP/IP. Players connecting need to have **identical** version of the vanilla PD2, it's DLLs and this mod.

## How to install

Head to [launcher repository](https://github.com/Lukaszpg/pd2-single-player-plus-launcher) and follow the instructions. This works right now only on Windows OS. If you have other operating system, please follow manual installation istructions below: 

a) With PlugY:

1. Copy your Diablo 2 game with Project Diablo 2 mod installed to a new directory.
2. Install PD2 Plugy for SP by BetweenWalls: https://github.com/BetweenWalls/PD2-PlugY#pd2-plugy. WARNING - The materials tab introduced in S11 tab will not work with Plugy! 2a. If you already have Plugy installed and played previous versions of this mod, please remove the contents of shared stash and create a new character.
3. Head to "Releases" and download most recent version of this mod.
4. Paste the downloaded "pd2data.mpq" file to ProjectD2 folder at your client directory, that you've created at step one.

7. Launch the game through the PlugY shortcut created in step 6.
8. Head to Akara and look for an item with Alkor's quest potion graphics. If it's there, mod was installed successfully. GLHF!

2. Create shortcut for PD2 Launcher from the new directory.

Newest release download: https://github.com/Lukaszpg/PD2-Single-player-mod/releases/tag/v9.0.0

## About this mod

Project Diablo 2 team did amazing job and stunned me and the other veteran D2 players with their high quality work. However, not everyone has the time to farm 24/7. This mod is for players that enjoy slaying plethora of monsters in Diablo 2, but don't have that much time to play in the way the Diablo 2 game and PD2 mod were designed, with abyssmal drop rates and item scarcity. If you have Infinity by day 3 of the PD2 ladder, then this mod is not for you.

## How to install

1. Copy your Diablo 2 game with Project Diablo 2 mod installed to a new directory.

2. Install PD2 Plugy for SP by BetweenWalls: https://github.com/BetweenWalls/PD2-PlugY#pd2-plugy.

* Scarab drop from Shadow of Mendeln event and Uber Ancients increased by 500% instead of 1000%

* Because the recipe to get 50x perfect gem was introduced, the pgems drop rate is back to PD2 vanilla level, to make more space for other good drops

* Jewelry drop rates are back to PD2 vanilla levels

* Map drop rates outside of maps lowered to 400% increase from 1100% - it’s plenty of maps still and makes more room for the good drops

* Bosses are no longer quest bugged

## Monster and zone changes

* Cows on Hell no longer have 100% increased density, it was too much and not well balanced change - it did compete with maps too much, given that cows have no immunities

* Baal throne room no longer has 100% increased density, this level is too small for that amount of monsters

## Fate shards

* Because Lilith’s Mirror and Vial of the lightsong drop rates were moved from hardcoded to softcoded, I’ve decided to remove fate shards for those items and increase the drop rates
    
* New Fate Shard - “Heritage” - stack of 2 - Gheed’s Fortune
* Changed fate shard icon

## Divine orb changes
*  Divine orb can be now used to reroll Rainbow Facets to different types

## Mythic orb changes

* Lowered the number of jewel fragments required to make Rainbow Facet from 25 to 15
    
* Fixed a bug where sometimes the item was made rare instead of unique

## New orbs

-   Eternal Coin (Coin in short) - its only purpose is to serve as an ingredient in exchange cube recipes, so you don’t have to sacrifice your Mal and Vex runes anymore. It’s also serving as a gold sink, as these don’t drop, but can be purchased for **500k** from a vendor.
    
-   As a result, the exchange recipes are as follows -
	-   3x Larzuk’s Puzzle Piece + Coin = Larzuk’s Puzzle Box
    
	-   Larzuk’s Puzzle Box + Coin = Vex
    
	-   Larzuk’s Puzzle Piece + Coin = Mal
    
	-   Lilith’s Mirror + 4x Coin = 4x Ber
    
	-   Vial of Lightsong + 2x Coin = 2x Ber
    
	-   Catalyst shard + Coin = 2x Catalyst Shard
-   New recipes:
	-   Any perfect gem in NOT STACKED FORM + Coin = 50 x of that perfect gem
	-   You can downgrade runes 1:1 with recipe Rune + Key. This works up to Ist rune.
-   Removed recipes:
	-   Larzuk’s Puzzle Box + Vex = 2x Larzuk’s Puzzle Box - with the introduction of Eternal Coin, it was too easy to print Larzuk’s Puzzle Boxes

## Charms changes

-   Because a new recipe to create a lot of perfect gems was introduced:
	-   increased Grand Charm chance to roll skills was decreased from 400% to 200%
    
	-   increased Large Charm chance to roll +% to damage type was decreased from 400% to 200%

## Cain’s wisdom changes

-   The main reason of introducing this item was to give a significant single player experience boost at high levels, in its current form it’s too much of a balance change - I’ve decided to remove +1 to all skills, 10-15% increased life and 10-15% increased mana, but the XP boost now rolls 150-200%. The recipe to create this item stays the same and it’s still limited to 1.
    
-   Can’t be corrupted by Tainted Worldstone Shard or regular Worldstone Shard anymore
-   Recipe: Twisted Essence of Suffering + Charged Essence of Hatred +  Burning Essence of Terror + Festering Essence of Destruction + Small Magic Charm

# Changes from Version 1.0.0

## General loot table changes

-   Rune drop rates increased by 500%. This means that when a rune drops it is 5 times less likely to downgrade to lower rune class. This change results in much more high and mid rune drops and much less lower rune drops

## Uber ingredients specific drop rate changes

-   Prime evil soul drop rate set at 15% from Hell Diablo and Baal
-   Key drop rates set at 20%

## Unique and set item specific changes

Unique and set items drop limit has been removed - the items are now able to drop more than one chance per game session; this change has been made to allow re-rolling mod values with divine orb more than once per game session

## Monster and zone changes

-   Monsters density has been increased by 100% in below Hell difficulty areas:
	-   chaos sanctuary
	-   pits level 1
	-   ancient tunnels
	-   worldstone keep 1,2,3
	-   arcane sanctuary
    
-   Champion packs density increased in above mentioned zones in Hell difficulty by 1-2 packs per zone
    
-   Monster immunities in T4 Dungeon lowered to 110%, so it can be broken just by single source of minus immunity, eg. Infinity Conviction Aura

## New orbs

A couple of new orbs have been introduced to ease the hunt for perfect unique and set items. All below mentioned items drop (~3% chance from “good drops” TC) in Hell difficulty:

-   **Mythic orb** - allows normal/magic/rare armor/weapon to be transformed into a unique item of that base. Allows magic/rare rings and amulets to be transformed into unique. Items must be non-corrupted and non-ethereal. Sockets will be removed. Cube with 15 jewel fragments to create a random rainbow facet.
    
-  **Divine orb** - allows to reroll mod values on unique or set weapon/armor. Unique items must have no sockets, be non-corrupted. Set items must have no-sockets and be non-corrupted. IF USED ON BASE THAT HAS MORE THAN ONE UNIQUE ITEM BOUND TO IT, IT CAN REROLL THE UNIQUE ITEM, eg. Tyrael’s Might can be changed to Templar’s Might.
    
-  **Exalted orb** - allows normal/magic/rare armor/weapon to be transformed into a set item of that base. Allows magic/rare rings and amulets to be transformed into set items. Item must be non-ethereal and non-corrupted. Sockets will be removed

## Fate shards

To ease the hunt for hardest to get items that can’t be deterministically obtained with Mythic Orb, like rings and amulets, a system called “Fate shards” was introduced. These shards are an uncommon drop from anywhere in hell (1.27% chance from “good drops” TC). All of the shards have the same weighting, but the better items require more shards.  
  
A stack of shards can be transformed in the cube for the item. Below are the shards that are in the game at the moment - name of the shard, how many of shard is required to get the item and what item it gives:

-   “Lawful Sentence” - stack of 3 - Tal Rasha’s Adjudication
    
-   “Luminescence” - stack of 3 - Mara’s Kaleidoscope
    
-   “Ammuit Treasure” - stack of 3 - Stone of Jordan
    
-   “Untethered Soul” - stack of 3 - Wisp projector
    
-   “Rotting Bride” - stack of 3 - Bul-Kathos’ wedding band
    
-   “The Man from the High Castle” - stack of 3 - Highlord’s Wrath
    
-   “Dawn” - stack of 3 - Rising Sun
